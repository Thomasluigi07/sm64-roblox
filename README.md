# sm64-roblox

A port of Super Mario 64's movement code into Roblox Luau (in `--!strict` mode), hosted as a [rojo](https://rojo.space) project. Based on the SM64 decompilation project hosted at: https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64

I wanted to make this public as a curiousity for anyone who wanted to know how I pulled it off. It **does not include any animations, sounds, or assets from Nintendo**. I do provide some of the scripts I used when I originally ported animations from the SM64 ROM into R15 Roblox avatars, but they are no longer in use.

Original game is hosted here:<br/>

## Setting Up & Disclaimers
This project follows standard rojo conventions. You should install vscode and install the rojo extension, as well as the rojo plugin for Roblox Studio.

Any bugs or behavioral quirks of the physics in this are intentional and will not be fixed. **No help will be provided for anything in here. It is NOT intended to be used as a foundation for new games and you're on your own if you choose to do so. Please also note that this is not intended to be merged/pull requested with the main repository by @MaximumADHD or @Nobonet.**

## Terms of Use

You *may* use this in your game, **but you must provide credit** to this repository and the SM64 Decompilation Project. I would **NOT** advise using it as a foundation for a platformer since it's very rigidly tied to the 30hz physics simulation code of Super Mario 64. It's weirdly programmed and not very intuitive to build off of.
